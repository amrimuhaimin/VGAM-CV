# VGAM-CV

This code is implementation of Vector Generalized Additive Models with Cross-Validation/n
We used ABALONE data from UCI dataset with some modification. We encode the Rings.Class variable into binary format, with criteria 0 = Rings.Class < Median; 1 = Rings.Class > Median, and we only use Male and Female on Gender Variable.
